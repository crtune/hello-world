# hello-world
Public Miscellaneous

Beginning Git training Apr 28, 2015.  I have created the recommended "hello-world" repository and related branch--readme-edits. I intend to keep general and training oriented materials in "hellow-world" repository, and create specific public or private repository instances for any projects I'm doing [I already have a project in mind].
